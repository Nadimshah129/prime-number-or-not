A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 which are divisible by only 1 and itself. For example 2, 3, 5, 7, 11…  are prime numbers because they can neither be divided nor is a result of the multiplication. Programs on Prime numbers are one of the most frequently asked Java interview questions for freshers. In this post, I have collected some of the important prime number programs in Java.

Program to check whether the given number is prime or not
Program to find out all prime numbers between two given numbers
Program to check whether the given number is prime or not using recursion
Program to check if the number is prime or not using a flag variable
Program to print prime numbers between 1 to 100
Let’s start with the first program.

Program to check whether the given number is prime or not?
In this java program, I will take a number variable and check whether the number is prime or not.

The isPrime(int n) method is used to check whether the parameter passed to it is a prime number or not. If the parameter passed is prime, then it returns True otherwise it returns False.
If the number is less than 1, if(inputNumber<= 1) it returns false.
If the number is not less than or equal to 1, performs division operation.
If the remainder is zero, it returns false, meaning it is not a prime number.
If it is a non-zero number, it returns true, resulting in a prime number.
package prime;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrimeNumberProgram
{
static boolean checkForPrime(int inputNumber)
{
boolean isItPrime = true;

if(inputNumber <= 1)
{
isItPrime = false;

return isItPrime;
}
else
{
for (int i = 2; i<= inputNumber/2; i++)
{
if ((inputNumber % i) == 0)
{
isItPrime = false;

break;
}
}

return isItPrime;
}
}

public static void main(String[] args)
{
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.println("Enter a number :");

int inputNumber = sc.nextInt();

boolean isItPrime = checkForPrime(inputNumber);

if (isItPrime)
{
System.out.println(inputNumber+" is a prime number.");
}
else
{
System.out.println(inputNumber+" is not a prime number.");
}

sc.close();
}
}
